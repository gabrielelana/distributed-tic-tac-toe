# Distributed Tic Tac Toe

The inspiration for the Tic-Tac-Toe comes from this blog post of [_Jason Gorman_](http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1196).

These are the instructions:

> Write a program that allows two players to have a game of Tic-Tac-Toe remotely. The program should know whose turn it is and enforce taking it in turns to make moves. The program should know whether a move made by a player is legal (i.e., is that square empty?), and be capable of detecting when the game is won or drawn. The outcomes should be reported to both players along with the current state of the game (e.g., by refreshing the screen).

The goal is to solve the problem in various ways and various languages to practice and learn distributed programming
